# Web CLI Example

The "webcli_config.py" script demonstrates bare-bones acesss to the ZumLink Web CLI. Note that this is not a true RESTful API (state can be changed via HTTP GET methods), but is rather intended to be a simple shortcut to device configuration using an HTTP interface.

## Usage

```python webcli_config.py```

The progam will simply run thorugh a list of demonstrations and print the output to the console. It can be run either on the ZumLink IPR from the developer environment, or from a remote computer, as long as the IP address of the device is routable.
