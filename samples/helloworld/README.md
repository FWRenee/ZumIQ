Hello World Examples
====================

Each of the scripts contained herein demonstrates a bare-bones "Hello World" application using a variety of programming languages and/or platforms. They contain the minimum code to get the app up and running, and should not be construed to be an exmaple of any sort of best practice.

Prerequisites
-------------

The ZumLink IPR ships with a very stripped-down Linux distribution to conserve storage and minimize firmware update overhead. To get these hello world examples running, you should run the following prerequsite scripts, located in /home/devuser/bin on the unit by default:

* **install-essentials.sh** - includes utilities like vim, curl, wget, and other developer tools
* **install-buildtools.sh** - includes compliers and other build tools for supporting dependencies that must be compiled
