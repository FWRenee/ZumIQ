Python Demo
===========

This demo will use several Python libraries for reading modbus registers and communicating via MQTT.

The source code for each radio's application will be in the respective folders, one for the radios reading modbus registers and the other for the radio receiving and charting the data.

Detailed explanations are provided for the Hardware setup and for the Software setup in the .rst files in this repo.
