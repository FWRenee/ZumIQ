12V Power Supply                       | FreeWave P/N: EMD1280UX. Used to power the Serial Base
USB Ethernet Adapter                   | Optional. Used to create a separate local network attached to a computer.
RJ45 to DB9 Null Modem Cable           | FreeWave P/N: ECD2408ED. Used with "Rainbow" data cable to connect IOE-44XX to Z9-P/PE.
"Rainbow" Data Cable (ASC3610DJ)       | FreeWave P/N: ASC3610DJ. Used to connect IOE-4422 with DB9 serial cable
USB-to-DB9 Serial cable                | FreeWave P/N: ECC2409US. Used with "Rainbow" cable to configure IOE-4422 using Tool Suite
Breadboard                             | For circuit prototyping.
10K Potentiometer                      | Used to vary voltage to simulate tank level.
LEDs (x2)                              | For indicating when tank level exceeds thresholds.
560Î© 0.5W resistors (2x)               | To reduce current across LEDs.
Jumper Wires                           | For wiring everything together.

## Serial Base Setup

[Tool Suite](http://www.freewave.com/tool-suite-programming-configuration-monitoring/) will be used to configure the channel behavior on the Serial Base. This document will only cover the settings required for the demo. For detailed instruction on setting up an IOEX-4422 Serial Base using Tool Suite, see the [IO Expansion User Manual and Reference Guide](http://support.freewave.com/knowledge-base/io-expansion-module-user-manual/)

The Tool Suite user manual and downloads are available on the [Tool Suite](http://www.freewave.com/tool-suite-programming-configuration-monitoring/) product page.

### Channel Configuration

#### Channel 1

This channel provides power to the potentiometer.

**Setting**          | **Value**
-------------------- | ---------
I/O Mode             | Sensor Power
Apply Default Output | Yes
Default Output       | On

#### Channel 2 and 3

These channels provide power to the LEDs.

**Setting**          | **Value**
-------------------- | ---------
I/O Mode             | Sensor Power
Apply Default Output | Yes
Default Output       | Off

#### Chanel 5

This channel is used to monitor the output voltage from the potentiometer

**Setting**        | **Value** 
------------------ | --------- 
I/O Mode           | Analog Input
Voltage or Current | Voltage
Zero Voltage       | 0
Voltage Span       | 12000
Resistor Pull      | Pull-up
Filtering          | None
Integer Type       | Unsigned

#### Stack Settings

These settings affect communication with all channels.

**Setting**                     | **Value**
------------------------------- | --------- 
Serial Protocol                 | RS-232
Port Speed                      | 19200
Parity                          | None
Stop Bits                       | 1 bit
Modbus Address Mode             | 8 bit
Modbus ID:                      | 1
Modbus Message Interval         | 2
AI Integer Result Justification | Left
Floating Point word Order       | Regular
Long Integer Word Order         | Regular
Default Delay                   | 60
Power Mode                      | Regular

### Verifying Configuration

Once configured with Tool Suite, power cycle the Serial Base. With a multimeter, test Channel 1 to ensure that it's providing 12V, and test Channels 2 and 3 to verify that they are providing 0V.

## Wiring Setup

Next, set up the components on a breadboard and connect them to the channels on the Serial Base. The following circuit schematic and breadboard layout diagrams show the desired configuration.

* Channel 1 provides power and ground to the potentiometer. 
* The center pin of the potentiometer is connected to Channel 5, which reads the voltage value
* The two LEDs are connected to Channel 2 and 3, using current-limiting resistors.

**NOTE:** When configured as "Sensor Power", a channel will output the same voltage as supplied to the Serial Base, in this case 12V, necessitating the current-limiting resistors.

## Z9-P/PE Setup

The "monitor" radio represents the radio at the network edge, connected to sensors and actuators, in our case, the potentiometer and LEDs.

### Connect Hardware

Connect the 10-pin data port on the top of the Serial Base to the right-hand serial port (COM2) on the ZumLink radio using the "Rainbow" data cable connected to the RJ45-to-DB9 null modem cable.
